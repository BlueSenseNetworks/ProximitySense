# Introduction

ProximitySense is an advanced cloud platform for proximity engagement and iBeacon infrastructure management. It is being developed by 
Blue Sense Networks - the UK leader in iBeacon hardware and one of the first companies to bring to market an iBeacon certified device (way back in the autumn of 2013).

Usually the first thing to do after a successful login is to create an **Application**. ProximitySense **Applications** feature allows 
access to additional, application specific features - such as proximity campaigns, analytics, API access among others. 
Think of an **Application** as a silo, where all data is stored for a specific purpose. For example, if you are creating a mobile app 
for a museum, you can create a **"Museum"** application in ProximitySense to act as the logical organisation of all your mobile application activities.
Another application - called **"Museum Dev"** for example, can be used when testing your mobile app, thus letting you separate actual from testing data.
