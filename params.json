{"name":"ProximitySense","tagline":"ProximitySense documentation and sample code","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nProximitySense is an advanced cloud platform for proximity engagement and iBeacon infrastructure management. It is being developed by \r\nBlue Sense Networks - the UK leader in iBeacon hardware and one of the first companies to bring to market an iBeacon certified device (way back in the autumn of 2013).\r\n\r\n## Getting Started \r\n\r\nPlease register for a free account at http://ProximitySense.com/Register if you haven't already done so.\r\nOnce you have verified your email address you should be able to sign in at https://platform.ProximitySense.com/Authorize/SignIn\r\n\r\nUsually the first thing to do after a successful login is to create an **Application**. ProximitySense **Applications** feature allows \r\naccess to additional, application specific features - such as proximity campaigns, analytics, API access among others. \r\nThink of an **Application** as a silo, where all data is stored for a specific purpose. For example, if you are creating a mobile app \r\nfor a museum, you can create a **\"Museum\"** application in ProximitySense to act as the logical organisation of all your mobile application activities.\r\nAnother application - called **\"Museum Dev\"** for example, can be used when testing your mobile app, thus letting you separate actual from testing data.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
